# Requirement-analysis
## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
-  focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system

## What is Requirement Analysis?
- Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
  
### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
  
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
### Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
- Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
- Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
- Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
- Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
###  Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
- Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
- Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
### Requirement Documentation üìö
- Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
- Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
### Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
- Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
### Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
- Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
- Definition: Describe what the system should do.
- Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

### Key Functional Requirements:
- Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
- User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
- Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
- Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
  
### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
- Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
- Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

### Key Non-functional Requirements:
- Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
- Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
- Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
- Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.
## Use Case Diagrams
- Objective: Visual representation of interactions between users and the system.

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
- Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
- Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team
